# Stress-Detection-On-Social-Media
This repository contains the coding using python from data preprocessing until deployment 

 IPython Notebook can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/sokqi918/Stress-Detection-On-Social-Media/blob/main/Coding/New_P1_Stress_detection%20(2).ipynb)

# Objectives
1. To explore the effective feature extraction techniques that can improve stress detection models.
2. To build stress detection model by applying machine learning techniques to accurately detect stress on social media.
3. To evaluate the selected machine learning models performance using suitable evaluation metrics.

# Methodology
In this project, we are using SEMMA to create our methodology.  
Dataset Link: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kreeshrajani/human-stress-prediction)

# Data Collection & Data Understanding
The dataset was collected from Kaggle, which consist of 7 features with 2838 rows. Before we start to do data cleansing, we would like to understand our dataset. Figure 2 showed the meaning for each column. Since we want to identify if the content is stressful or not, the column of “label” is our target variable in this case. 1488 users are identified as stress, while 1350 users are identified as non-stress. The target variable is quite balanced.

# Feature Extraction Techniques
Logistic Regression with TF-IDF are outperforming among all models in term of accuracy, which achieved at 76.23%. Naive Bayes is well performed in BoW and TF-IDF as well, achieved F1-Score of 79.76% and 78.42% respectively.
